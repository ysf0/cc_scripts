# CC_SCRIPTS

# ABOUT PROJECT

Multi-purpose shell functions.

All these functions are wrapper functions because they only call other commands (like grep, cat, curl, ipconfig...) which available on your local machine. Some example functions can be seen [below](https://github.com/ysf0/cc_scripts/blob/master/README.md#example-functions).

You can use all functions from:

- any terminal
- inside docker (or any container)
- remote machine (via ssh)
- inside another script file
